CarDash
=======

This is a simple iOS app that communicates with an ELM OBDII (OBD2) car interface device.

The ELM module(s) supported are network to serial interfaces that use wifi to communicate.

Therefore, the communication method is just a simple serial socket, with data parsing.

This app is extremely basic; I only pull the PIDs I personally care about, and the UI is tailored for only my own use.

Please feel free to fork away and customize for your own needs, or submit a pull request if you do something we'd all benefit from!
